# Added a folder auto-scripts to hold the .py files used to generate some of randomly generated .sql files
The is not an autoscript for the SHOE_STORE table or its corresponding WAREHOUSE_ADDR Table those were generated by hand
IF you do auto generate using any of the scripts and want to insert the .sql files insert them in this order to avoid conflicts

SHOES->SHOE_STORE_CUSTOMER
ACCOUNT->INVENTORY->ORDERS->CUST_ADDR->WAREHOUSE_ADDR

*SPECIAL NOTE* ORDERS requires getting an array of the varying shoe prices if you auto script SHOES you will need to follow the instructions
in orders_insert.py to get an array of values to replace in the code.
